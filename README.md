## Reflection
Technical Skills
Throughout this assignment, I gained extensive hands-on experience with REST APIs, OAuth2 authentication, and testing methodologies. The project provided an opportunity to delve deep into the inner workings of a REST API, understanding its structure, endpoints, and the intricacies of request and response handling. Implementing username and password validations enhanced my understanding of data integrity and security best practices. Additionally, tackling profile field edge cases emphasized the importance of handling various scenarios gracefully to ensure a smooth user experience. Debugging issues related to OAuth token generation and user profile updates honed my problem-solving skills and reinforced the significance of thorough testing and validation in software development. Working on this project underscored the importance of effective collaboration and version control using Git and GitHub. Creating branches for each issue, managing pull requests, and conducting code reviews facilitated a structured and organized workflow. These practices not only helped in maintaining code quality but also promoted knowledge sharing and team cohesion. The experience of using GitHub Issues for tracking bugs and enhancements was invaluable in managing tasks efficiently. Through this collaborative effort, I learned how to communicate effectively, seek feedback, and contribute to a shared codebase while adhering to best practices. This assignment was a comprehensive learning journey that challenged me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. One of the key insights was the importance of writing comprehensive test cases to achieve high test coverage, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability and robustness of the application. The process of increasing the project's test coverage to 90% involved meticulous planning and execution, highlighting the critical role of automated testing in modern software development. Even though I struggled a lot and still did not manage to get to 90% test coverage I spent hours and tried my best. Additionally, the challenges faced while debugging and resolving issues provided valuable lessons in perseverance and critical thinking. Overall, this assignment has equipped me with essential skills and a deeper understanding of the software development lifecycle, preparing me for future endeavors in the field of software engineering.
